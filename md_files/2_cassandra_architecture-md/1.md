lab 2. Cassandra Architecture
---------------------------------

In this lab, we will discuss the architecture behind Apache
Cassandra in detail. We will discuss how Cassandra was designed and how
it adheres to the **Brewer's CAP** theorem, which will give us insight
into the reasons for its behavior. Specifically, this lab will
cover:

-   Problems that Cassandra was designed to solve
-   Cassandra's read and write paths
-   The role that horizontal scaling plays
-   How data is stored on-disk
-   How Cassandra handles failure scenarios

This lab will help you to build a good foundation of understanding
that will prove very helpful later on. Knowing how Apache Cassandra
works under the hood helps for later tasks around operations. Building
high-performing, scalable data models is also something that requires an
understanding of the architecture, and your architecture can be the
difference between an unsuccessful or a successful cluster.
