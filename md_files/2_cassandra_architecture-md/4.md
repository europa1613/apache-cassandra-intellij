Cassandra's write path
----------------------

* * * * *

Understanding how Cassandra handles writes is key to knowing how to
build applications on top of it. The following is a high-level diagram
of how the Cassandra write path works:

Figure 2.3: An illustration of the Cassandra write path, showing how
writes are applied both to in-memory and on-disk structures

When a write operation reaches a node, it is persisted in two places.
There is an in-memory structure known as a **memtable**, which gets the
write. Additionally, the new data is written to the commit log, which is
on-disk.

### Note

The commit log is Cassandra's way of enforcing durability in the case of
a *plug-out-of-the-wall*Â event. When a node is restarted, the commit log
is verified against what is stored on-disk and replayed if necessary.

Once a flush of the memtable is triggered, the data stored in memory is
written to the sorted string table files (**SSTables**) on-disk. The
data is sorted by token value in memory, and then written to disk in
sequential order. This is why Cassandra is known for its log-based,
append-only storage engine.

Some quick notes about the write path:

-   Data is sorted inside SSTables by token value, and then by
    clustering keys.
-   SSTables are immutable. They are written once, and not modified
    afterward.
-   Data written to the same partition key and column values does not
    update. The existing row is made obsolete (not deleted or
    overwritten) in favor of the timestamp of the new data.
-   Data cannot be deleted. Deletes are considered to be writes, and are
    written as structures called **tombstones**.
