On-disk storage
---------------

* * * * *

When rows are written to disk, they are stored in different types of
file. Let's take a quick look at these files, which should be present
after what we did in previous lab.


### SSTables

First of all, let's `cd` over to where our table data is
stored. By default, keyspace and table data is stored in the
`data/` directory, off of the `$CASSANDRA_HOME` 
directory. Listing out the files reveals the following:

Copy

``` {.programlisting .language-markup}
cd data/data/fenago/hi_scores-d74bfc40634311e8a387e3d147c7be0f
ls -al
total 72
drwxr-xr-x  11 aploetz aploetz  374 May 29 08:28 .
drwxr-xr-x   6 aploetz aploetz  204 May 29 08:26 ..
-rw-r--r--   1 aploetz aploetz   43 May 29 08:28 mc-1-big-CompressionInfo.db
-rw-r--r--   1 aploetz aploetz  252 May 29 08:28 mc-1-big-Data.db
-rw-r--r--   1 aploetz aploetz   10 May 29 08:28 mc-1-big-Digest.crc32
-rw-r--r--   1 aploetz aploetz   16 May 29 08:28 mc-1-big-Filter.db
-rw-r--r--   1 aploetz aploetz   27 May 29 08:28 mc-1-big-Index.db
-rw-r--r--   1 aploetz aploetz 4675 May 29 08:28 mc-1-big-Statistics.db
-rw-r--r--   1 aploetz aploetz   61 May 29 08:28 mc-1-big-Summary.db
-rw-r--r--   1 aploetz aploetz   92 May 29 08:28 mc-1-big-TOC.txt
```

The `mc-1-big-TOC.txt` file is the table of contents file for
the directory. Listing its contents essentially shows the same list of
files as we have previously. Some of the other files match up with parts
of the Cassandra read path:

-   `mc-1-big-Index.db` :** **Primary key index (matches
    partition keys to their data file positions)
-   `mc-1-big-Summary.db` :** **Partition summary
-   `mc-1-big-CompressionInfo.db` :** **Compression offsets
-   `mc-1-big-Filter.db` :** **Bloom filter
-   `mc-1-big-Digest.crc32` : Contains a **Cyclic Redundancy
    Check** (**CRC**) or **checksum** value for the uncompressed file
    chunks

 

The last file is `mc-1-big-Data.db` , which contains the data
for the table. Listing out the contents of the file with a system tool,
such as cat, will be cumbersome to read. So we will examine this file
using some of the tools that come with Apache Cassandra.

#### How data was structured in prior versions

In Apache Cassandra versions 0.4 to 2.2, SSTable data was structured by
row key. A row key kept a map of columns underneath it with their
values. These columns were sorted by their column key. If you consider
the key/value map structure from Java, it's easy to think of it as a map
of a map.

As an example, consider the following CQL query from the previous
lab. Recall that it retrieves video game high-score data for a
player named `Connor` :

Copy

``` {.programlisting .language-markup}
cassdba@cqlsh:fenago&gt; SELECT * FROM hi_scores WHERE name='Connor';
 name   | game        | score
--------+-------------+--------
 Connor |     Frogger |   4220
 Connor |       Joust |  48850
 Connor | Monkey Kong |  15800
 Connor |      Pacman | 182330
(4 rows)
```

This CQL query and result set make sense in the way it is shown, mainly
for those of us who have a background in relational databases. But this
is not how the data is stored on-disk. In Apache Cassandra versions 1.2
to 2.2, CQL is simply a layer that abstracts the SSTable structure. If
you were using Apache Cassandra 2.1 or earlier, this data could be
viewed with the command-line interface tool, also known
as `cassandra-cli` :

Copy

``` {.programlisting .language-markup}
bin/cassandra-cli 192.168.0.101 -u cassdba -pw flynnLives
Connected to: "Rush" on 192.168.0.101/9160
Welcome to Cassandra CLI version 2.1.13
The CLI is deprecated and will be removed in Cassandra 2.2.  Consider migrating to cqlsh.
CQL is fully backwards compatible with Thrift data; see http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/thrift-to-cql3

=&gt; (name=Frogger:, value=, timestamp=1527640087988234)
=&gt; (name=Frogger:score, value=000000000000107c, timestamp=1527640087988234)
=&gt; (name=Joust:, value=, timestamp=1527640087990162)
=&gt; (name=Joust:score, value=000000000000bed2, timestamp=1527640087990162)
=&gt; (name=Monkey Kong:, value=, timestamp=1527640087986113)
=&gt; (name=Monkey Kong:score, value=0000000000003db8, timestamp=1527640087986113)
=&gt; (name=Pacman:, value=, timestamp=1527640087984003)
=&gt; (name=Pacman:score, value=000000000002c83a, timestamp=1527640087984003)
1 Rows Returned.
```

A few things to note here:

-   We defined the partition key as the `name` column, which
    does not seem to be present here. But the get query works by simply
    retrieving data for `RowKey` of `Connor` .
-   The `game` column was defined as our clustering key.
    Again, `game` itself is not present here, but we can see
    that the score recorded for each game seems to be keyed by the
    game's title (such
    as `name=Frogger:score, value=000000000000107c, timestamp=1527640087988234` ).
-   The CLI informs us that one row has been returned. As far as the
    storage layer is concerned, all cells (column keys and their values)
    constitute a single row.

The most important thing to remember from this example is that all data
underneath a particular partition key is stored together. This is an
important lesson that we will draw upon heavily in the next lab.

#### How data is structured in newer versions

In versions of Apache Cassandra from 3.0 on, the underlying data is
structured slightly differently. The Cassandra storage engine was
rewritten as a part of this release, providing several benefits.

Consider the CQL query used as the basis for the prior example, where we
queried our the `hi_scores` table for the player named
`Connor` . If we were to look at the underlying data using the
`sstabledump` tool, it would look something like this:

Copy

``` {.programlisting .language-markup}
tools/bin/sstabledump data/data/fenago/hi_scores-73a9df80637b11e8836561ec0efea4b2/mc-1-big-Data.db
[ {
   "partition" : {
     "key" : [ "Connor" ],
     "position" : 0
   },
   "rows" : [
     {
       "type" : "row",
       "position" : 44,
       "clustering" : [ "Frogger" ],
       "liveness_info" : { "tstamp" : "2018-05-29T12:28:07.988225Z" },
       "cells" : [
         { "name" : "score", "value" : 4220 }
       ]
     },
     {
       "type" : "row",
       "position" : 44,
       "clustering" : [ "Joust" ],
       "liveness_info" : { "tstamp" : "2018-05-29T12:28:07.990283Z" },
       "cells" : [
         { "name" : "score", "value" : 48850 }
       ]
     },
     {
       "type" : "row",
       "position" : 66,
       "clustering" : [ "Monkey Kong" ],
       "liveness_info" : { "tstamp" : "2018-05-29T12:28:07.986579Z" },
       "cells" : [
         { "name" : "score", "value" : 15800 }
       ]
     },
     {
       "type" : "row",
       "position" : 94,
       "clustering" : [ "Pacman" ],
       "liveness_info" : { "tstamp" : "2018-05-29T12:28:07.984499Z" },
       "cells" : [
         { "name" : "score", "value" : 182330 }
       ]
     }
   ]
 }
```

 

It's important to note from this JSON output that the data for
`Connor` is divided into a hierarchy of three distinct
sections: `partitions` , `rows` , and
`cells` . Whereas before there were simply partitions
containing cells of data, rows are now a first-class citizen in the
Cassandra world. In this way, CQL is no longer an abstraction, but
rather a fairly accurate representation of how the data is stored. This
will be discussed in more detail in the next lab.

### Note

Even with the new storage engine, it is still important to note that all
data underneath a particular partition key is stored together.
