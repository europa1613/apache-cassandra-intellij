# Apache Cassandra with IntelliJ IDEA 

### Overview

Starting with a quick introduction to Cassandra, this course flows through various aspects such as fundamental data modeling approaches, 
selection of data types, designing a data model, choosing suitable keys and indexes through to a real-world application, all the while 
applying the best practices covered in this course. Although the application is small, you will be involved in the full development life 
cycle. You will go through the design considerations of coming up with a flexible and sustainable data model for a stock market 
technical-analysis application written in Python. As business changes continually and so does a data model, you will also learn the
techniques of evolving a data model to address new business requirements. Running a web-scale Cassandra cluster requires many careful 
considerations such as evolving a data model, performance tuning, and system monitoring. This course is an invaluable tutorial for anyone
who wants to adopt Cassandra.
